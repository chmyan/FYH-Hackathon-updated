{"content": "A BlueJ tip for you today. Let's look at how to expand the font size. Sometimes text in BlueJ is a little bit small. Let's open an editor of a class and have a look at the text by going to Options and then Preferences. And we find Font size in the Editor tab. So, this one here, you can see it's 12. So, we can just choose a larger font size. So, I don't know, 24 for example, and apply and you see the font size has changed. Let's go back for a minute to 12. And the alternative is in fact here in the Tools menu. There is an option here directly to control the font size directly. So, I can change the font size here between larger or smaller directly from the Tools menu. And this changes the font size of the whole BlueJ application including the class diagram and the object inspector and so on. BlueJ is written in Java and Java has a concept of a default Look and Feel and that Look and Feel determines what BlueJ actually looks like exactly a number of options if you are interested. If you select it here this is likely the Java default of metal look. Yeah, but if you like some other options it will then restart BlueJ or you can try them out. You would have to restart BlueJ to actually see it. Some of them don't actually change much and some of them may not even be available on your system, but some of them might. So if you want to play with those you can actually try this one. Right. That's all for today. See you next time.", "metadata": {"url": "https://keats.kcl.ac.uk/mod/kalvidres/view.php?id=9155107", "timestamp": 1763221889344, "chunk_id": "chunk_1763221889318.txt"}}
